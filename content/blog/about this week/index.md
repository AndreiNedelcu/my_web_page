This week I have been learning more about how to use React.js, watching a tutorial on YouTube. It has helped me a lot to understand React concepts like Props and States. I plan to learn a little more about JavaScript as I think it will help me more to understand React. Next week I plan to improve this web page by adding things like a dark mode (which I love) and a main page and another dedicated to the blog.

See you next week.
