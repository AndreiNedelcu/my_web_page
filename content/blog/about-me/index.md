description: This is my first post in my blog.

My name is Andrei and I am 16 years old. I live in MalagÃ³n, a lost town in Castilla la Mancha, Spain. Since I was little I really liked technology. I loved to dismantle computers or radio controlled cars. I think I took that from my brother [Dragos](https://www.dragosgn.com/), he took all my toys to dismantle them and create other things ðŸ˜‘. I loved seeing computers inside and discovering how they work.
I have 8 brothers and sisters, 2 of them are in Berlin working as software programmers. As children we were all motivated to learn to program by my brothers. I started with simple things in HTMl, but then I left it, a pity. But taking advantage of the quarantine, my brothers founded a mini company with the Nedelcu's family. They motivated me to start programming again and I did it, that's why you are reading this ðŸ™ƒ. I am learning JavaScript, I like the language because it is easy to understand what you are doing. I've learned a little about React and now I'm trying to learn Gatsby. For me Gatsby is very difficult to understand, I do not understand half of what I do and I have to spend a lot of time looking at the code to understand it.

This has been my first entry as a mode of presentation, I hope there will be many more and that I will continue to be motivated to continue programming in the future, who knows, maybe in 10 years I will read this and tell myself "thank goodness you kept programming friend. "

See ya
